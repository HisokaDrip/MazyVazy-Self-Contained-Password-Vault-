⚡ MazyVazy (Browser Edition)
A lightning-fast, secure password manager that lives in your browser.
MazyVazy is a single-file application designed for speed and ease of use. Unlike traditional apps, you don't install it. You just open the HTML file, and it uses your browser's secure internal storage to keep your passwords safe.
🌟 Why use this version?

Instant Access: No need to manage files. Just open the bookmark and unlock.
Auto-Saving: Your data is saved to the browser automatically. You don't need to download a new file every time you make a change.
Zero Dependencies: It's just one HTML file. No internet required.
AES-256 Encryption: Your data is locked with military-grade encryption before it is ever saved to the browser.
🚀 How to use it
1. Installation
Download MazyVazy.html.
Save it somewhere safe (like your Documents folder).
Pro Tip: Bookmark it in your browser for fast access.
2. First Run
Open the file.
Set a Master Password. This creates your new encrypted vault.
Important: Do not forget this password. There is no reset button.
3. Daily Use
Add, edit, or delete passwords.
The app saves automatically to your browser's Local Storage.
When you are done, just close the tab. Your data stays encrypted in the browser's memory.
⚠️ Critical Warnings
1. Do Not "Clear Browsing Data"
Your passwords live inside the browser's "Local Storage" or "Cache."
If you run tools like CCleaner or click "Clear History/Cookies/Site Data" in Chrome/Edge, YOU WILL DELETE YOUR PASSWORDS.
Recommendation: Whitelist this file or be very careful when clearing cache.
2. Not Portable by Default
Because the data lives in this specific browser on this specific computer:
If you copy the HTML file to a USB stick and put it in a different computer, it will open as an empty vault. The passwords do not travel with the file in this version.
🔒 Security
Encryption: Uses the Web Crypto API (AES-GCM 256-bit).
Local Only: No data is ever sent to a cloud server.
Session Security: The decrypted data exists only in RAM. If you refresh the page, you must log in again.
